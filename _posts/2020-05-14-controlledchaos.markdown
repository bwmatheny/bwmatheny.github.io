#"ControlledChaos".

Hi everyone! My name is Brian Matheny. I want to go ahead and introduce myself for you to understand what built up to my desire for a career in coding. 

I am 33 years old and live in Charleston, SC with my beautiful wife. We just got married this past October and are very busy trying to plan our many adventures together!!!

My wife and I are both Paramedics. I love my job! (I really do!!) but let me explain exactly why.

it's all about the chaos!!!! Think about it, If you need to call 911, this is probably the worst day of your life. A real emergency and you don't know what to do!!! It doesn't matter your profession, but if you don't regularly interact with tragedy and extreme urgency, MOST people will be caught off guard. This is where I come in!!!!

Something has happened that is outside the bounds of what you can handle (I mean, why else would you call 911??). Typically, there of course, is a huge sense of urgency. Whatever needs to be done, it needs to be done NOW! ( again, why else would you call 911?) Most of the time, whatever the incident is, it has grabbed the attention of usually, many people. But they're just as lost as you! Now you're screaming, they're screaming, but no one is really doing anything. They're just waiting for SOMEONE to help. It only takes me a few minutes to get there, but to you, it's been an eternity! With all the chaos and noise around you, here we come!! because NOTHING calms down a panicky hoard of people like bright flashing lights and a load siren, right??? 

This is my time to shine!!! This is what I do best!!! To you this is the worst thing that's every happened, but to me? Just another Tuesday! That doesn't mean I ,move with less urgency. This doesn't mean it's any less important to me. But it DOES mean that "I've got this!!" 

At this point, you've already had people all around you, and none of them knew what to do either! But I do! and most importantly, you feel a great sense of relief. The scene calms down, and here we are talking to you in a calm, matter-of-fact tone that reassures you, you're in good hands. It's not as bad as it looks, and we are here to take care of you! 

This is what I do, I take the chaos that is all around you and I calm it. Channel it appropriately and remain in control. This is the environment we thrive in. But it's not that simple. This comes from years of training, knowledge and experience, and guess what..... It's not that straight forward. There is still a mystery that we have to solve. What caused this? How do I prevent anyone else from getting hurt? I do I safely bring you out of it? And most important, what, medically, is the problem??

It's this! Solving those riddles. Controlling the environment. Capturing those variables and pointing all of it to an overall solution. I love the mysteries I love solving the problems quickly, and consisely to take care of those in need! 

This is what drives me. answering the questions and solving the mystery. Doing what others couldn't to find the solution. 

To me, programming is the same way. Each code is simply a solution to a question, and finding out how to come up with something that is best for everyone!

I have always loved technology and using technology to solve for problems that others don't even realize are problems. 

It has been 15 years of doing what I love! But this career comes at a cost. Physical costs, and emotional costs. The price is getting higher every day and it is time to find a new journey! I look forward to a career in coding! It is my hope to find a job working with Public Safety. Making the job easier, safer, and more productive.
