This app was made to be able to pull and view the top songs in the country. Billboard publishes a Top 100 list every week. However, this long of a list can be difficult to navigate. I have provided an option to decide just how long of a list you would like to see, from 1-100!


Top 10 songs for this Week:
1. 'Rockstar', by DaBaby Featuring - Roddy Ricch
2. 'Savage', by Megan Thee Stallion Featuring - Beyonce
3. 'Blinding Lights', by The Weeknd
4. 'Roses', by SAINt JHN
5. 'Intentions', by Justin Bieber Featuring - Quavo
6. 'Say So', by Doja Cat Featuring - Nicki Minaj
7. 'The Bigger Picture', by Lil Baby
8. 'Whats Poppin', by Jack Harlow
9. 'Blueberry Faygo', by Lil Mosey
10. 'Circles', by Post Malone

Select the song you want more info on or type list to return or exit:


This is actual data, acurate as of the day of this post.
After printing a list of songs ranked acording to Billboard, you are given another input option to get further info into a songs movements. This does not really give more stats, but more of the type of introduction that you would hear on the radio while listening to the countdown. i.e. ( "Climbing to the top this week, DaBaby rises to the Number 1 song in the country with 'Rockstar, Featuring - Roddy Ricch") 

But how boring would it be if this was the only message you get for 10, 20, 30, or 40 songs (depending on the length of your choice.) Therefore, this app tends to shake it up a little, depending on the songs performance in the charts. 

Whether the song is rising or falling from last week.
If it is new on the Chart for the first time.
What the highest place the song has reached!

There are about 7 or so different formats of the message to Introduce the song in this week's chart!
Each statement is arranged based on conditional if, elsif statements to ensure that the statement makes sense, is grammatically correct, and highlights the attributes of that song in particular. 

There are also statements that fit the same requirements, therefore, included in the code is also a random number generator to flip the statements around just to mix it up a little!!

This program could be expanded to do so much more very easily. More statement formats, more charts, different genre's and more, with simple tweaks to the coding because everything is fluid to work with ever-changing data!

Examples:

After 15 weeks on the chart Megan Thee Stallion rises 2 spots to Number 2 this week with 'Savage, Featuring - Beyonce

Holding strong this week Doja Cat holds on to the Number 6 spot again with 'Say So, Featuring - Nicki Minaj'

Peaking all the way at Number 3. Lil Baby's song 'The Bigger Picture' falls by -4 to number 7 this week
